Photon-Gold Matrix ‚Äì a commons-based theoretical design for solar hydrogen production using gold nano-matrices 
OpenHydrogen: The Photon-Gold Matrix

**A Commons-Based Vision for Clean, Decentralized Hydrogen**

This project introduces the **Photon-Gold Matrix** ‚Äî a theoretical design for direct solar water splitting using **photon-induced localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR)** in a structured gold nanomatrix.

## üöÄ What's Inside

- **Theoretical framework** for photon-only water splitting  
- **Design documents** for a fractal gold nanostructure  
- **An open letter to the world** inviting scientists and engineers to build it  
- **A commons license and ethical charter** for responsible, regenerative use  

## üß™ How It Works (In Theory)

Gold, when structured into specific nanoscale geometries, may be able to concentrate solar photons into nanoscale hot spots strong enough to break the bonds in water - without electricity, semiconductors, or wires.

This system could offer a radically simple, emission-free pathway to hydrogen energy.
